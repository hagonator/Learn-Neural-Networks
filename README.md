# Neural Network Exploration
Here I will implement my first Neural Network and subsequently try to explore the possibilities.

Goals:
1. implement a simple Neural Network for MNIST digit classification
   - first following this pytorch tutorial (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
2. implement a convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification
3. ...
